Android App is composed of three components::

1. AndroidMainfest.xml, which can be thought of as the app's configuration file, containing various app-related information
2. Resources include layout, strings appearing in the program, images, and all other information.
3. Code

AndroidMainfest.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapplication">

    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
        android:supportsRtl="true"
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:theme="@style/AppTheme.NoActionBar">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>

</manifest>

From this file, we can learn several things such as
1. The app's package name is com.example.myapplication.
2. This app has an activity named Mainactivity, which is the main entry point or main activity.

Each app has a unique package name which can be thought of as the app's ID and is written in the AndroidMainFest.xml.

If you go to the web version of Google Play, 
you will find that the URL contains the package name. 
For example, the URL of Facebookâ€™s page looks like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana&hl=zh_TW&gl=US
So, com.facebook.katana is the package name of the Facebook app.


What is an activity?

Activity is a screen. Each screen is an activity.

If it is an app that requires registration to use, there may be the following screens:
1. Welcome page
2. Registration page
3. Login page
4. Main page(display after successful login)

Each activity may have a layout.
In android development, a layout is actually an XML file.
